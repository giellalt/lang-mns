# Status
## for the work

Coverage:

- Luima Seripos: 230627: 1-110000/713183 = 0.846

## for the fst

### Problems with verbs

Verbs and nouns are quite alike, but we look at different forms.
The verbal stem is close to the noun lemma. Trond has check

# Priorities onward

## Linguistic:
- Go through the missing lists of both LS and textbook.
- Look at LS missing lst and textbook missing list. Goal: Textbook 100% and LS 95%, thereafter LS better than 95%.


# Summer

Csilla will work, and consult Trond or Jack whenever running into trouble.

## working with missing lists

Two ways of working:
    
1. Csilla adds missing words to fst and typos to typos.txt
2. Csilla uses the file.missing.freq.date file and writes comments to each word, one of the following:
    - fixed (or: no comment means "Csilla fixed it")
    - correct # this means: must be fixed in fst
    - typo > correctform # means: Csilla adds it to typos.txt

Trond to make sure the missing lists are run without long vowel problems.

## Working with Yamls

Csilla to make sure they are ok. Lemmas should be tested only once.


## Next meeting

We will look for a date it in a month or so (perhaps less).
