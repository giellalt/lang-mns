# Speller suggestions

The testbed is finally working, the testfile needs finetuning.

We will return to this topic at the next meeting. 

# Verbal inflection

Question: What kind of verbs can have OC? Is this linked to transitivity?

Strategy:
    
Leave the lexicon name as they are, but there either go ahead to inflection or do derivation and then go to inflection.

TODO: Perhaps Csilla to comment on the docs/Verbal_inflection.md document and say what processes are.

A  good start is the reflexive tags.

Remember adding the tags:
    
+Der/Refl





# Next meeting

- Work as usual and then:
