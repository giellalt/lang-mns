# Agenda

- Testing
- Prefixes

# Testing

Csilla has added words, Trond has updated test diary. We turn 91 % for Luima Seripos coverage. Also added mnshun dictionary coverage.

# Prefixes

We discussed *хот та са̄грапасаге*, i.e., prefix strings. We will consider seing this as three words, the last being са̄грапаӈкве, instead of seeing it as one word хот-са̄грапаӈкве.

Discussion continues.
